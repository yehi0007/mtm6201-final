# Habiba Yehia Portfolio

This is a responsive and accessible portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and services as a web developer. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **Bootstrap framework**, this website emphasizes intuitive design and seamless user experience. The website uses **Roboto** as the primary font for a modern and clean look.
